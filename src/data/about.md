# A brief intro to me
My name is Aritra Ghosh.

<br>

I'm currently a student at the Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata, on track to graduate in 2025 with a remarkable CGPA of 9.40.

My professional journey reflects my commitment to delivering innovative solutions and creating a tangible impact. I've gained valuable experience at renowned organizations.
At Karmactive, I led the design and implementation of web pages, enhancing user experiences and engagement.
As a Software Development Intern at CareEdge Solution Pvt. Ltd, I developed scalable and robust APIs in Python, automating ML model serving and building secure models for risk assessment, customer churn analysis, and categorization. I deployed secure and production-ready APIs.
My freelance work as a web developer involved overseeing six projects, all delivered on time and within budget. My expertise in optimizing website structure and implementing SEO/SEM strategies resulted in increased traffic and improved page rankings.
I actively contribute to the open-source community, participating in programs such as GSSOC, SSOC, TSOC, and Hacktoberfest, reflecting my passion for collaboration and knowledge-sharing.

Proficient in a diverse technical stack, including MERN technologies, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Django, Flask, and a comprehensive understanding of machine learning libraries, I'm particularly interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

As an enthusiastic problem solver, I tackle challenging queries daily on platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces. My dedication to expanding my skill set remains unwavering.

Beyond technology, I've authored research papers focusing on "Application AI in the prevention and Awareness of Domestic Violence" and "An Overview of Summarization." I've also achieved success in four national-level hackathons.

My active involvement as part of the technical team at Diversion 2022, an open-source hackathon organized by IEM Kolkata, underscores my dedication to community-driven initiatives. As the technical team co-lead in CodeIN Community, I orchestrated and led a team of 30 individuals.

I'm currently focused on refining template-based summarization models while seeking dynamic, fast-paced roles to apply my comprehensive skill set and knowledge.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I'm engaged in photo and video editing, extensive reading and music.

I'm eager to connect with fellow professionals, discuss innovative projects, and explore potential collaborative opportunities. Let's connect and channel our enthusiasm for technology and innovation!
